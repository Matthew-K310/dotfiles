# dotfiles

This contains all the dotfiles that I want to be synced between both my systems (Mac and Linux)

### BRANCH DIFFERENCES

The ```main``` branch is the core configs, and these can be used on any system (maybe not Windows)

The ```arch``` branch includes configs from my Arch Linux system (waybar, hyprland, etc.)

The ```mac``` branch includes configs from my MacOS system (aerospace, raycast, sketchybar, etc.)
